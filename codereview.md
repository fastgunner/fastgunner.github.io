## Code Review

### Software Design/Engineering
For this part of the project, I opted to modify the jukebox code from my CS310 class and add functionality to look up each song in a playlist on wikipedia, and present the end user with a wikipedia page for the song.  I took the jukebox code, and added a runtime object and then passed that runtime object the windows default browser dll as well as the URL I wanted to open in the form of "https://en.wikipedia.com/wiki/NAME_OF_THE_SONG"  

### Algorithms and Data Structures
For this part of the project, I created a quicksort method from scratch that takes in input from a comma seperated value file or CSV file.  It iterates through the file, stores all the data in an arraylist, and then converts that array list to an array for the quicksorter class to handle.  The quicksorter class, sorts the data, and then returns the sorted data.  Currently the program only accepts integers as an input but it can technically also accept an iterator class should one be available and provided.

### Databases
For this part of the project, I opted to use an interview prompt I received to create a mySQL database, and a web form that end users can input a name, address, and phone number.  Then the user can select if they want to create a new entry, update an existing entry, replace an entry, or delete an entry with the name being the primary key in the database.
