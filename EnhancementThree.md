## Enhancement Three

This artifact is an interview project I was requested to make for a job interview I took.  The prompt I was given was as follows

“An example of the CRUD functionality of a telephone book using SQL Express database and window forms or web for the inputs?”
What I used to accomplish this was first building out an HTML page, then using JavaScript to execute a PHP function which handled the database inputs.  You could also select from Create, Read, Update, and Delete.  

The planned enhancement I completed is the creation of the mySQL database. This artifact will show I am able to handle full stack development work including the SQL database portion.  

Some future enhancements would be the sanitization of SQL inputs to prevent SQL injection attacks, the addition of graceful error handling, and a live feed of the database on the fly.
