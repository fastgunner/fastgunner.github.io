## Enhancement Two

For this artifact I wrote up a quicksorter that takes in an array from a CSV file and sorts the array using the quicksort algorithm.  This is a straight forward method for sorting and is very effective at sorting multiple large data sets.  I included this in my portfolio because a lot of the coding interviews want an example of an implementation of quick sort, merge sort, or selection sort.  

I had originally intended to add merge and selection sort although those can be added later.  They are easier to implement than quicksort.  I did not find this artifact as difficult because I wrote the code rather than inheriting a framework from a professor like the jukebox app.  I want to add additional sorting methods and handle sorting CSV files more gracefully rather than just single column CSV files.

Some additional features to add in the future are the ability to weight different columns and sort by all weighted columns individually, returning the results.  The app also struggles with keeping the data together as it will not return a multidimensional array.
