## Enhancement One



The artifact is the Jukebox app from CS 320.  I took and added a search functionality to the jukebox app that will query Wikipedia with the title of the song so that you can see more information about it.   

I chose this artifact because it shows my ability to work collaboratively on a group project and use GIT effectively to branch, write my code, and merge it to master.  Additionally the search functionality shows the ability to create an app that can interface with outside data such as JSON objects.
